# Excel Creation Issue - Fixed

## Problem
Excel file creation was failing, causing the application to exit silently without creating the expected Excel output.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `CreateExcelFile` method in `Program.cs`. The method was trying to create **duplicate worksheet names**:

1. It created a manual `measurementTable` with name "Measurement Cycles"
2. It then added `data.Tables` which already contained a table named "Measurement Cycles"
3. This caused a conflict: "A worksheet with this name already exists in the workbook"

## Solution Applied

### Before (Broken Code):
```csharp
var measurementTable = CreateMeasurementTable(data);
var tablesToExport = new List<PdfDataExtractor.TableData> { measurementTable };

if (data.Tables.Any())
{
    tablesToExport.AddRange(data.Tables); // ❌ Creates duplicate "Measurement Cycles"
}
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```csharp
var tablesToExport = new List<PdfDataExtractor.TableData>();

if (data.Tables.Any())
{
    // Use the extracted tables directly since they already contain the measurement data
    tablesToExport.AddRange(data.Tables);
}
else
{
    // Fallback: create measurement table manually if extraction didn't work
    var measurementTable = CreateMeasurementTable(data);
    tablesToExport.Add(measurementTable);
}
```

## What This Fix Does

1. **Prioritizes Extracted Data**: Uses the tables extracted from PDF (which work correctly)
2. **Eliminates Duplicates**: Only creates manual table if extraction failed
3. **Maintains Functionality**: Keeps the fallback mechanism for edge cases

## Test Results

✅ **Excel Creation**: Successfully creates `ExtractedExcel.xlsx` (3,646 bytes)  
✅ **Content**: Contains all 10 measurement rows with correct data  
✅ **Format**: Proper headers, formatting, and summary information  
✅ **Location**: Saved in `excel/ExtractedExcel.xlsx`  

## Current Status

The Excel creation is now working perfectly. The application will:

1. **Extract data** from PDF (10 measurement rows)
2. **Create Excel file** with all measurement data
3. **Write to OPC UA** (when Kepware is running)

The fix ensures that Excel files are created reliably without worksheet name conflicts.
