- **Status values** - Extracts status/condition information
- **URLs** - Extracts web URLs (http/https)
- **Numbers** - Finds numeric values (excluding single digits)

### Custom Pattern Extraction
You can define your own regular expression patterns to search for specific data types such as:
- Social Security Numbers
- Credit Card Numbers
- Invoice Numbers
- Product Codes
- Custom IDs
- Any pattern you can define with regex

### Table Extraction & Excel Export
The application can detect and extract tabular data from PDFs:
- **Measurement Cycles Tables** - Automatically detects tables with cycle data
- **Excel Export** - Exports extracted tables to Excel (.xlsx) format
- **Formatted Output** - Preserves table structure with headers and data types
- **Auto-naming** - Creates Excel files named after the source PDF

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

## Dependencies

The application uses the following NuGet packages:
- **itext7** (v7.2.5) - PDF processing library compatible with .NET Framework 4.8
- **itext7.bouncy-castle-adapter** (v7.2.5) - Cryptographic support for iText7
- **EPPlus** (v6.2.10) - Excel file creation and manipulation library

## Common Regex Patterns

Here are some useful regex patterns for custom extraction:

| Data Type | Regex Pattern | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| SSN | `\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}` | Social Security Numbers (XXX-XX-XXXX) |
| Credit Card | `\d{4}[\s-]?\d{4}[\s-]?\d{4}[\s-]?\d{4}` | Credit card numbers |
| ZIP Code | `\d{5}(-\d{4})?` | US ZIP codes (5 or 9 digits) |
| Invoice Number | `INV-\d{4,6}` | Invoice numbers starting with "INV-" |
| Product Code | `[A-Z]{2,3}-\d{3,5}` | Product codes (letters-numbers) |
| Currency | `\$\d+(?:\.\d{2})?` | Dollar amounts |
| Time | `\d{1,2}:\d{2}(?::\d{2})?\s?(?:AM|PM)?` | Time formats |

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- File not found errors
- Invalid PDF files
- Corrupted PDF files
- Invalid regex patterns
- File access permissions

## Tips

1. **File Paths**: Use full file paths for best results. Drag and drop the file into the console to get the path automatically.

2. **Regex Testing**: Test your custom regex patterns on small samples first to ensure they work correctly.

3. **Large Files**: For very large PDF files, consider not including the full text output to improve readability.

4. **Multiple Files**: Run the application multiple times for different files, or modify the code to process multiple files in batch.

## Troubleshooting

- **"File not found"**: Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists
- **"Invalid PDF"**: The file may be corrupted or password-protected
- **"Access denied"**: Check file permissions or close the PDF if it's open in another application
- **"Invalid regex"**: Verify your regular expression syntax is correct
